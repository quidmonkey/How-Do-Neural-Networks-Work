# How Do Neural Networks Work?

This repo is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that attempt to explain how neural networks work in very simple terms. You will need to install the latest version of [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) using Python 2.x to read the notebooks. Once Anaconda is installed, run `jupyter-notebook` in the project's directory to load up the Jupyter server and read the notebooks.
